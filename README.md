##  Compressed Sensing using OMP(Orthogonal Matching Pursuit).


#### -Implemented a python based pipeline for end-to-end image compression and reconstruction task.

#### -Utilised DCT(Discrete Cosine Transform) domain representation for compression and Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), a recursive

#### -An algorithm for reconstruction in the IDCT(Inverse Discrete Cosine Transform) domain, which focused on minimizing the L2-norm between reconstructed and original image

#### -Achieved Peak Signal to Noise Ratio of 29 on single channel image, with the compression rate being 46%.

##### This setup is good for applications that require a balance between file size and quality. And the a moderate compression rate (46%), good image quality (29.03 dB), and efficient processing time (1.86 seconds).
